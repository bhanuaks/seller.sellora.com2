            <h2>Sellora offers three main types of promotional strategies to help sellers boost visibility and
                  sales:</h2>

                <ul>
                  <li><strong>a: Sale Events </strong> Sellers can participate in platform-wide or category-specific
                    sale events (e.g., seasonal sales or flash deals). These events feature curated promotional periods
                    where products receive prominent placement and increased customer exposure.</li>
                  <li><strong>b: Discount Coupons </strong> You can create custom coupons to offer price discounts
                    (percentage- or fixed‑amount) on your products. Coupons are an effective tool to encourage
                    conversions and can be tailored for first-time buyers, minimum purchase thresholds, or bulk
                    purchases.</li>
                  <li><strong>c: Influencer Marketing </strong> Sellora enables collaboration with influencers or
                    affiliate partners to promote your products. Through this channel, influencers feature your items in
                    content, sharing affiliate-based links or discount codes that help drive traffic and sales.</li>
