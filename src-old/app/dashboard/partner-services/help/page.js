          <h3>What is the Sellora Partner Network and how does it work?</h3>
          <p>
            The Sellora Partner Network connects you with a range of trusted
            service partners to help scale your business on the Sellora
            platform. You can explore partners offering services such as product
            imaging, catalog management, account optimization, marketing
            support, and inventory sourcing. After selecting a service based on
            partner profiles, pricing, ratings, and reviews, you can submit a
            request to the partner. The partner will then reach out to you
            directly to initiate the service.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Who are the Partners listed under the Sellora Partner Network?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Partners in the Sellora Partner Network are third-party service
            providers carefully chosen to offer specialized services to Sellora
            sellers. Sellers can negotiate terms and conditions directly with
            these partners. The responsibility for service quality and delivery
            lies with the partners, while Sellora serves only as a platform to
            connect sellers with these service providers.
          </p>
          <h3>Do I need to pay for the services?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes, these are paid services. Partners charge based on the services
            you avail. Occasionally, partners may offer exclusive discounts or
            promotions to Sellora sellers, but such offers are at the partners’
            discretion. Payments for services are made directly to the service
            providers.
          </p>
          <h3>
            What if I am dissatisfied with the service delivered by the
            partners?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Before engaging a partner, you can agree on service quality
            standards and terms with them. These terms are strictly between you
            and the service provider. If you’re dissatisfied with the service,
            you can contact the partner to request revisions or refunds as per
            your agreement. Additionally, you can share your feedback with
            Sellora’s seller support team, and we will forward it to the
            partner, who will address the issue directly with you.
          </p>
          <h3>How are Partner Ratings calculated?</h3>
          <p>
            After a service is completed, sellers can provide feedback and rate
            the partner’s performance. The overall rating for a specific service
            is calculated by combining individual ratings for that service. A
            partner’s overall rating reflects the cumulative average of all
            ratings received across their services.
